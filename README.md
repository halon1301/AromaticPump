## This device may be used in ways which can be unsafe.  I take no responsibility for unsafe usage, be smart and think with the head on your shoulders, not between your legs.
## DO NOT USE THIS DEVICE ALONE
## DO NOT USE WITH VOLATILE COMPOUNDS

Now that I've got the safety stuff done, let's get on to the fun stuff.
